# Prompt History Record

## Original Prompt
```
/sp.specify Frontend Authentication & Build Configuration Error Resolution
Hackathon 2 – Phase II
Next.js + Better Auth Frontend

Objective:
Define a specification to resolve frontend authentication runtime errors
and Next.js build warnings related to request configuration and workspace root detection.

This specification describes WHAT must be corrected to ensure stable
authentication flows and clean frontend startup behavior.
```

## Response Summary
Successfully created a comprehensive specification for resolving Next.js frontend authentication and build configuration errors. The specification addresses runtime errors in authentication flows and build warnings related to request configuration and workspace root detection.

Created complete spec, plan, and tasks files that document:
- The authentication flow stability requirements
- Request configuration handling improvements
- Workspace root detection mechanisms
- Better Auth integration enhancements
- Frontend startup behavior optimizations

The specification includes functional requirements, user scenarios, success criteria, and implementation constraints for stabilizing authentication flows and eliminating build warnings in the Next.js + Better Auth frontend application.

## Outcome
Created a complete SDD specification for the frontend authentication and build configuration fix that defines the requirements for stable authentication flows and clean frontend startup behavior. The specification provides clear documentation for the implementation team to follow in subsequent phases.
